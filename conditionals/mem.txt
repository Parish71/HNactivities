diagram about the logic of the program
start -> x<y if true -> "x is less than y" if false-> x>y -> if false not print
search on the internet for more details

update elif commit to compare.0.0 -> compare.0.1

analysis of the new fluxogram

update else commit to compare.0.0 -> compare.0.1

analysis of the new fluxogram

update or and change the intent of the code in analysis if x is equal or not to ycommit to compare.0.2 -> compare.0.3

"Can i make less questions?"

Use logic
